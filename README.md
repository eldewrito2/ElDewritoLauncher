# ElDewrito Launcher

ElDewrito Launcher helps you install and play the latest version of ElDewrito, a mod for the cancelled Halo free-to-play PC game "Halo: Online." The old ElDewrito 0.6 updater has been deprecated in favour of this brand new all-in-one launcher and installer. This provides users with more or less a single click install for ElDewrito!

## Running ElDewrito Launcher

1. Download the latest `launcher.exe` from the releases tab to any folder on your PC
2. Run `launcher.exe`
3. Follow the installation wizard

**NOTE**: The ElDewrito Launcher uses a Peer-To-Peer (P2P) network to deliver updates. If prompted please allow it through your firewall.
