# ElDewrito Launcher

ElDewrito Launcher helps you install and play the latest version of "ElDewrito," a popular mod for the cancelled Halo free-to-play PC game "Halo: Online." The old ElDewrito 0.6 updater has been deprecated in favour of this brand new all-in-one launcher and installer. This provides users with a "single click" installation process for ElDewrito

## Running ElDewrito Launcher

1. Download the latest `launcher.exe` from the releases tab to any folder on your PC
2. Run `launcher.exe` and follow the installation wizard (**NOTE:** If you are prompted to allow the launcher / installer through your firewall, please do so!)
3. It is not recommended to update a pre-existing ElDewrito 0.6 install with the new ElDewrito launcher.
