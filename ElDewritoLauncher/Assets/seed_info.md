### What is seeding?
Seeding is the act of sharing pieces of a file that you've downloaded with other users in the network. This helps to maintain the availability of that file for other users. In essence, the more seeders there are for a file, the faster it can be downloaded by new users.

### What gets uploaded?
Only the core ElDewrito game files (the files that were downloaded as part of the install) will be uploaded for other users as needed. NO personal info or user content, preferences, profiles, mods, map variants, game variants etc.. get uploaded.

### How do I limit it?
On the Seeding tab in the settings, click the the cog icon (next to the start button). There you will be able to set the upload rate limit.

### What if I have mods?
in-game mods will work fine, however, If you have modified any of the core ElDewrito game files (the files that were downloaded as part of the install) you will not be able to seed through the launcher. Head over to the Files tab and click "Verify Files" to restore these files before seeding.

### Other ways to seed
You can also seed through your favorite torrent client or through a dedicated seed-box. You can find the torrent file and magnet link in the Seeding settings tab.
