## How downloads work
ElDewrito uses BitTorrent, a Peer-To-Peer (P2P) file-sharing protocol designed for distributing large files over the internet. It works by breaking the files into smaller pieces, which are then shared among multiple computers (peers) in the network. When a user downloads a file using BitTorrent, they simultaneously upload pieces of the file to other users. This decentralized approach results in faster download speeds and reduces the strain on any single server or network connection.

## How updates work
ElDewrito uses a (Distributed-Hash-Table) DHT network to store the latest release. This information is signed by us in an offline system, and cannot be changed by anyone else. This allows us to push out updates in a **secure** way while also being fully decentralized.

In a DHT network, data is stored across multiple computers (nodes) rather than in a central location. The DHT algorithm is used to determine which nodes hold a piece of data, and then retrieve it directly from those nodes. DHT is also leveraged by BitTorrent to connect you to peers that have the needed files. 

## How you can help
Seeding helps us keep the game alive! Seeding is the act of sharing pieces of a file that you've downloaded with other users in the network. This helps to maintain the availability of that file for other users. In essence, the more seeders there are for a file, the faster it can be downloaded by new users. 

To start seeding head over to Settings > Seeding in the launcher once your installation has completed. You can also seed with a torrent client or a dedicated seed-box.
